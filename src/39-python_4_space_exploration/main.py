Exploration Ground Systems - The spacecraft needs more powerful rockets and more resources to enable longer-staying and
further-reaching crewed missions. The ground systems on Earth need to be upgraded and improved.
Space Launch System - The new rocket that's being designed isn't just for the Moon, it's a rocket design meant to be
used for future launches to planets such as Mars. The system that's needed to launch this new rocket into space must be
more flexible and able to evolve than previous versions, to account for varying destinations and cargo.
Orion - The spacecraft that will be used both for the crew to enter the lunar orbit and return to Earth safely needs to
be designed to withstand the extreme heat it will experience during re-entry into Earth's atmosphere.
Gateway - The communication between the astronauts on the Moon (or beyond) and the experts on Earth is more critical as
we go further and stay longer. The Gateway outpost is being redesigned with commercial and international partners so
that NASA can prepare for future missions.
Human Landing Systems - Lunar landers let astronauts move from the lunar orbit to the surface of the Moon reliably and
safely. These systems need to be able to dock to both Orion and the Gateway in order to support discoveries and the
sustainability of conducting research on the Moon or other planets.
Artemis Generation Spacesuits - Although astronauts have successfully walked on the Moon in the past, the new
exploration goals require that spacesuits last longer and are more flexible. See NASA's Suit Up page for details on the
two new types of suits. These spacesuits can let astronauts stay in them longer, move more easily, and be safe through
launch and re-entry to Earth.
